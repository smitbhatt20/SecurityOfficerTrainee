Nmap Script Engines:
->During the vulnerability assessment of `www.itsecgames.com`, a targeted Nmap scan was performed on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) using multiple NSE scripts to gather detailed information about the web server and its security posture.
->The scan revealed that port 80 is open and running an **Apache web server**, supporting HTTP methods such as GET, HEAD, POST, and OPTIONS.
->Analysis of HTTP headers indicated that certain security headers, such as HSTS and X-Frame-Options, were missing, which could potentially leave the site vulnerable to attacks like clickjacking.
->Port 443 was filtered, indicating restricted access for HTTPS.

->Additional scripts like `http-title` and `http-security-headers` helped identify the web page title and confirmed the absence of some recommended security headers, while `ssl-cert` and `ssl-enum-ciphers` provided information about the SSL/TLS configuration, revealing supported protocols and the certificate issuer.
->-Overall, the Nmap scan provided essential insights into the serverâ€™s services, HTTP methods, headers, and SSL/TLS implementation, forming the basis for further vulnerability analysis and mitigation recommendations.
