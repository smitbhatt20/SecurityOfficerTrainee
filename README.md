The objective of this assessment was to evaluate the security posture of the target web application.  
I performed initial information gathering (DNS lookup, server details) followed by web vulnerability scanning to check open ports, HTTP headers, methods, technologies used, and SSL/TLS configuration.  

Findings show that the server is running Apache with HTTP enabled and redirecting to HTTPS.  
Headers and scans revealed details about technologies in use, possible misconfigurations, and areas where security hardening may be needed.  
Automated scanners were used to check for outdated components, common vulnerabilities, and exposed information.  

The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate a systematic approach to identifying risks and presenting clear evidence of potential weaknesses that attackers could exploit, along with the importance of mitigation through patching, secure configuration, and reducing information exposure.
